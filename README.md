What countries are at the forefront of emerging technological advancements, and what constitutes public opinion surrounding new technology?
I use GeoPandas to visualize what countries are at the forefront of emerging technologies and use the Google Books API and the Reddit 
API to analyze public opinion. I will be looking into the world of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, virtual reality, 
and blockchain, to gain insights into their potential implications and analyze the ongoing debates surrounding them. This project explores 
trends in these developments and examines the sentiments expressed by online users. Furthermore, it investigates which countries are at the 
forefront of these advancements and new technologies.
