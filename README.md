What countries are at the forefront of emerging technological advancements, and what constitutes public opinion surrounding new technology?
I will be looking into the world of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, virtual reality, 
and blockchain, to gain insights into their potential implications and analyze the ongoing debates surrounding them.
The first section uses GeoPandas to visualize what countries are at the forefront of emerging technologies. The second and third sections use the Google Books API and the Reddit API to analyze public opinion around emerging technology. Using the Reddit API, I use data from the r/DarkFuturology subreddit and get related terms for technological advancements to analyze user opinions on them. I use the Google Books API to find books on different technological advancements and compare the author's opinions on them. Overall, this project explores 
trends in technological developments and examines the sentiments expressed by online users. Furthermore, it investigates which countries are at the 
forefront of these advancements and new technologies.
